student_time_mapreduce
======================

This is a map reduce project for Hadoop that analyzes the peak hour during which a user is most active on a web forum.  This project is a solution for a problem that was assigned by an online CS classroom website (to avoid the risk of sounding like a salesperson, I won't mention which one).
